A project created by me at NSIT Financial Hackathon in 8 hours.

* **Idea**

> The Idea behind this project was that there are several stock monitoring softwares but some of them are paid and rest of them do not     show the stocks of our interest or on our demand.
  My project gives live stock prices update and it also works as a Portfolio Manager where you can add the stocks you own, the price you   bought them at and the amount you own and it'll return you all the information about the corresponding stocks in **REAL TIME** and that   too for **FREE**.

* **How is it free ?**
